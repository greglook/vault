# Vault Schemas

TODO: discuss EDN as the preferred serialization format for higher-level data.
TODO: determine how data 'types' are identified.

I've also had some random thoughts about somehow storing 'expected schemas' in
vault, which the system can use to validate data. This requires that there
somehow exists a notation for the 'latest' schema of various types, and tying
data to the schema it was stored under.
