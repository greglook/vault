# Vault

A Clojure library and application to store documents in a content-addressable
datastore while maintaining a secure history of entity values.

This is heavily inspired by the [Camlistore](http://camlistore.org/) project.
Vault does not aim to be (directly) compatible with Camlistore, but many of the
concepts are similar, and the stored metadata would probably not be that hard
to convert.
